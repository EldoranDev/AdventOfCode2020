## Commands

```bash
# Create new Day
# will create entry points and download input file to inputs/
./aoc --year <year> create [day]
```

```bash
# Fetch input of day

# this command can be used to fetch the input for a given day
./aoc --year <year> get [day]
```

## Inputs

My personal inputs are not shared in this repository.

Althouhg it is not strictly forbidden it is [asked by the creator](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e7khy8/are_everyones_input_data_and_by_extension/fa13hb9/) to not share/collect personal inputs.
